## Hello there, stranger!
I'm a math-loving, self-taught programmer who's been in the programming world for over two years now. Currently a student in University. Every day I'm learning about new software tech, and I'm constantly expanding my skillset.
### Here's what I've been diving into:
- **Languages**: Python (most proficient), Kotlin, JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Frameworks** & Libraries: Svelte, Next.js, React, Preact, Django, SolidJS, FastAPI
- **Frontend**: CSS preprocessors, Vite, Webpack, Web Assembly
- **Backend**: RESTful APIs, Full-stack development
- **Databases**: Redis, Cassandra, MongoDB (working with Celery) (SQL on the learning horizon)
- **Mobile**: Mobile app development
- **Hardware & Math:** Arduino, digital electronics, mechanical engineering (made many 7-segment displays and calculators in Minecraft :joy:)
- **Cloud & DevOps:** Azure, Google Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Machine Learning (Future Focus and career)**: PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **Math Libraries:** Sympy, NumPy and Scipy
- **Bonus:** I have a huge crush on Rust (one day I'll work on it, I promise!). Can do just basic programs and play with memory

While the best I can do now is Python and full-stack web development, I am still getting used to cloud solutions and databases, but I am learning very quickly!
By today I have a really big project, my startup, a Wolframalpha-like tool (only for math), but actually free!
